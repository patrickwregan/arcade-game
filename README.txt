Steps required to play game.

1. In your file browser, navigate to index.html and load this file into your
internet browser.
2. The young woman is your character. You move her with the arrow keys. She can
move up down right and left.
3. Your goal is to get to the blue water at the top of the screen. To do so, you
have to avoid the bugs. If you hit a bug or a bug hits you then you are send back
 where you started from.
4. If you make it to the water, you get reward of 1 key which is displayed along
the bottom of the screen.
5. If you get 5 keys you win and the game resets to displaying 0 keys.

notes:
I couldn't figure out a way to give the player a reward for getting 5 keys so I
reset the game.
The reason the character above the bottom of the screen is to leave room for the
stars to be displayed.
